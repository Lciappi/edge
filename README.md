## Edge  -*Small loans for great ideas*

Description of Edge:

Peer to peer loans are revolutionising the financial industry. The idea is to create a 
platform where people who need money (borrowers) and investors willing to give money
(lenders) can meet. Borrowers get the money today by promising lenders that they will
pay back the money, with an additional interest rate. Investors are willing to take on
the risk (of not getting their money back) in order to have more money in the future.
This concept is nothing new, and banks have been doing it for centuries, however, by
removing them from the transactions, investors can get higher returns and borrowers
get lower interest rates. 


The program will have 2 types of users:
 - borrowers
 - lenders
 
 Rationale:

As someone that has lived in capitalist countries all my life, I know how
important it is for people to have access to money. Loans make the economy work,
and they can help materialize great ideas and innovations. Peer to peer lending 
also allows lenders to have complete control of how their money is being allocated,
as opposed to traditional bank accounts, were customers do not have a say on how their
money is allocated.
