## Edge  -*Fuel for great ideas*

Description of Edge:

Edge is a platform that aims to connect investors
with entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs, looking to start or 
expand their business, will issue loans and investors 
will offer their capital in return for interest payments.

The program will have:
 - an administrator, which adds companies'
   loans to the program.
 - users, that choose which loans to invest in
 
 Rationale:

As a member of a capitalistic society I believe that it is important
to provide technologies with the necessary capital to execute their plan. As an investor,
I believe that a low interest rate environment, and an overvalued stock market
means that it is hard to find safe investment opportunities. And as a son, I have
seen the impact the pandemic has had on many small businesses, and fresh capital
could allow companies to re position themselves and create jobs.
